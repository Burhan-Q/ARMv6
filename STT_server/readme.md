# To Use the Fine-Tuned LLM

To use the fine-tuned version of the Gemini model, you need to authenticate via OAuth first. Read more at [Authentication with OAuth](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication_with_OAuth.ipynb).

After authentication, reach out to me (gokul) on Discord or [here](https://github.com/gokul6350) so that I can grant you access to the model.

Due to Google's rules, I cannot make this model publicly accessible.

I will soon fine tune lama model and make it public
