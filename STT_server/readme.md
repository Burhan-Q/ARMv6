# To Use the Fine-Tuned LLM

To use the fine-tuned version of the Gemini model, you need to authenticate via OAuth first. Read more at [Authentication with OAuth](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication_with_OAuth.ipynb).

Then open colab <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/gokul6350/ARMv6/blob/main/STT_server/fast_whisper_server.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

After authentication, reach out to me (gokul) on Discord or [here](https://github.com/gokul6350) so that I can grant you access to the model.

Due to Google's rules, I cannot make this model publicly accessible.

I will soon fine tune lama model and make it public
